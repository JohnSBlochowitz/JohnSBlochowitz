- _I'm currently working on building my Level 2 certification rocket and learning how to play guitar._ 🎸
- _I don't really know what my favorite hobby is since I have quite a few, but in terms of putting my knowledge to use, high power rocketry is probably the best!_ 🚀
- _My current hobbies are rocketry, guitar, piano, watchmaking, 3D printing, astrophotography, and games._ 🎮
